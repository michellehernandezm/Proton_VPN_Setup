<h1>Proton VPN - Setup and Usage</h1>
This tutorial outlines the process of retrieving and observing IP addresses of computers in different locations. We will observe our own desktop IP address, then the IP addresses within a Azure virtual machine. We will use Proton VPN to change our IP address and observe the changes. <br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [How To Install Proton VPN with Prerequisites](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)


<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

<p> Step 1 : On your desktop, go to (https://whatismyipaddress.com/) and locate your IPv4 adress and location.
</p>
<br />

 Once you log into the website, it will have the current location of your device and the IPv4 address. Take note of these details.
</p>






<p> Step 2 : Create VM Machine in Azure.
</p>
<br />
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/65vRsY7.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Proton_VPN_Setup"/>

In your Azure portal, "create" a new Virtual Machine and fill in with the following:
 
 VM Name: VPNPractice
 
 Region: Europe France Central
 
 Image: Windows 10
 
 Size: 2vcpus
 
 Username: labuser
 
 Password: (create something you will remember)
 
 Once all information is filled click "Review + Create"
 
</p>
<br />

<p> Step 3 : Connect to VM through Remote Desktop
</p>
<br />

 Once VM is created copy the "Public IP Address"

<p>
Open up "Remote Desktop" in a Windows computer or "Microsoft Remote Desktop" in a Mac. Paste the Public IP address and "Add" the PC. Once added, continue with the username and password you created back in Step 2.
</p>
<br />

<p> Step 4 : Inside the VM login to (https://whatismyipaddress.com/) again and locate your VM's IPv4 address and location. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
The location for your Virtual Machine should say Paris, France.  Take note of the IPv4 addresss and location for future reference.
</p>
<br />

<p> Step 5 : Create an account with Proton VPN. 
</p>
<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0cqZPPT.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="create"/>
 
 
 In your regular browser (not VM browser) search the web for https://protonvpn.com/ and click on "Create a free account" 
</p>
<br />

 </p>
<br />

  Proceed to create your personal account.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Go back to VM and log into your newly created Proton VPN account. From your dashboard, locate the "downloads" tab from the left hand side of the page. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
 
 Proceed to download Proton VPN for Windows and follow instructions to complete installation.
</p>
<br />

<p> Step 7 : Connect to Japan Virtual Private Network
</p>
<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/88VzKS8.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

 Open your new Proton VPN app to see this screen. Observing the IP Address, it should match the IP address from Step 4.
 </p>
<br />
 
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/yIuPcQV.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
 Hover mouse over "Japan" and click "Connect"

 </p>
<br />
 
 
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/l87Tpj4.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
As you connect to the Japan VPN your remote desktop connection may freeze. Reload remote desktop and see that you are now connected to the Japan server.
</p>
<br />

<p> Step 8 : Open up (https://whatismyipaddress.com/) again and view changes
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Your Virtual Machine has a new IP address located in Japan!
</p>
<br />

<p> Step 9 : Browse through websites
</p>

</p>
<p>
Browse through websites like google.com, netflix.com, or starbucks.com. Enjoy your exploring!
</p>
<br />


<p> Step 10 : Delete Virtual Machine
 </p>

</p>
<p>
It's now time to delete your resources on Azure. Be sure to delete the "VPNPractice" virtual machine and the resource group. Finally, log off of Remote Desktop and you're done!
